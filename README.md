## Feature Ideas To Work On
- [ ] Share button to share website with current group you're viewing

- [ ] Most common phrase/word algorithm
- [ ] Groupology/predictability score
- [ ] Determining type of group (business, casual, etc.)
- [x] Most liked recent message

## Bugs that need fixing
- [ ] Images still sometimes do not get cropped properly (blue circle shows up)
- [ ] Handle edge case with only one person in group (no love birds)
- [ ] Handle edge case of group with no chats yet
- [ ] Resizing problems on mobile
